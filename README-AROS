ssh2-handler is filesystem for accessing files remotely using the SFTP
protocol. It is based on libssh2 1.10.0 and uses AmiSSL for SSL encryption
/decryption.

Requirements:

- filesysbox.library 54.3 or newer
  (https://github.com/salass00/filesysbox/releases).

- z.library 2.1 or newer (https://github.com/salass00/z_lib/releases).

- AmiSSL 4.12.

Usage:

Create a DOSDriver with the following contents:
Handler   = L:ssh2-handler
StackSize = 65536
Priority  = 5
GlobVec   = -1
Startup   = "<args>"

Where <args> should follow the template:

HOSTADDR/A,PORT/N/K,USER/A,PASSWORD,VOLUME,READONLY/S,NOSSHAGENT/S,KEYFILE/K,
ROOTDIR/K

HOSTADDR is the IP address or domain name of the SSH server.

PORT is the port number (defaults to 22).

USER is the user name.

PASSWORD is the login password or key file passphrase depending on the
authentication method used. If this argument is left out a password requester
will be used instead.

VOLUME is the AmigaDOS volume name (defaults to <user>@<hostaddr>).

READONLY sets the filesystem to read only mode.

NOSSHAGENT stops filesystem from attempting to connect to ssh-agent.

KEYFILE can be used to change the key file used for public key authentication
(defaults to "$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa" or "HOME:.ssh/id_rsa").

ROOTDIR sets the root directory to use as the root of the volume (defaults to
"/").

To connect to a SFTP server with IP 192.168.1.16 and port 122 using username
"user123" use:

Startup = "192.168.1.16 PORT=122 user123"

If you want the handler to be started immediately on mount, rather than on the
first access, then make sure that ACTIVATE=1 is set in either in the icon
tooltypes or in the DOSDriver file itself.
